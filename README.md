# Bookstore Management System (MERN Stack)

Welcome to the Bookstore Management System! This web application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to provide a simple and efficient solution for managing books in a bookstore. Users can perform operations such as adding, editing, deleting, and viewing books that are stored in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Easily add new books to the database with information like title, author, genre, and more.
- **Edit Books**: Update the details of existing books, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the database when they are no longer part of the bookstore inventory.
- **View Books**: Browse through the list of books in the database, getting a comprehensive view of available titles.
